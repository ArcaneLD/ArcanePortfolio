# Arcane's Portfolio
# _(A website is coming)_


Hi ! I'm Arcane, but you can see me as "the french computer guy".
Oh, and also, I'm a Dev :

- Experienced Java Dev (2 years +)
- Web Dev Student (HTML, CSS, JS, NodeJS, Python, ect..)
- SysAdmin & Server Manager

## What's my job ?

- Code want me to code in Minecraft, that can go from setup a server to code a plugin/mod
(In fact I can do much more than Minecraft plugins/mods but that's what this portfolio's about soo..)
- Help you improve your ideas by using my experiences and what I know about MC 
- Be ready to help when you need me (Not all time because well I sleep sometimes)
- Manage an IT Team if you ask me too ! üëç
- Help in any other tasks I can (I'm quite polyvalent) and bring you positivity and fun !

## Techs

I used these techs in the plugins you gonna see :

- [Java] - OOP Programming language 
- [Bukkit/Spigot API] - API that allows to make Minecraft plugins with Java
- [NMS] - A sort of unobfuscated Minecraft Source Code (Geek Stuff)
- [Twitch4J] - A cool Wrapper that allows to connect Twitch to our plugins and it's quite useful I'd say


## Projects

Here's some public project that I worked on (almost all linked to a github repo or a spigot post) : 

- [AMT](https://github.com/Arceus81/AllMobsTrade) | AllMobsTrade Is a plugin that allows you to trade with almost every mobs in the game like you'd do with a Villager
